"""Variant registry for Cosmos-Predict 2.5 checkpoints.

Cosmos-Predict 2.5 is the **base DiT** in the Cosmos 2.5 family --
upstream of Cosmos-Transfer 2.5 (which is "Predict + ControlNet
residual branch").  For volumetric EM segmentation we use it purely as
a feature extractor: the upstream text/image/video conditioning is
fed null embeddings inside the wrapper.

Architectural fields are inherited verbatim from
:class:`nanocosmos.models.cosmos_2_5_common.variants._VariantConfigBase`;
no Predict-specific extension fields are needed (no ControlNet).

Release notes
-------------
The 2B variant lives at ``nvidia/Cosmos-Predict2.5-2B``.  As of
2026-05 the diffusers-format branches published on that repo are::

    diffusers/base/post-trained   # default below
    diffusers/base/pre-trained    # earlier checkpoint, less polished

We pin ``diffusers/base/post-trained`` -- the closest analog to
Cosmos-Transfer 2.5's ``diffusers/general`` base DiT -- so Predict
and Transfer warm-start from comparable weights.
