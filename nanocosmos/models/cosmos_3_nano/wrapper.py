"""The public :class:`Cosmos3Nano3DWrapper` model.

Cosmos 3 (Nano) is NVIDIA's 16B omnimodal world model.  Its generator
is a Mixture-of-Transformers (``Cosmos3OmniTransformer``) that jointly
models text / image / video / audio / action; for volumetric EM
segmentation we drive only its diffusion (video) tower as a feature
extractor and feed null conditioning for every other modality.

Almost all scaffolding (HuggingFace download, VAE encode, multi-layer
feature extraction via persistent block hooks, the unified-head decoder
adapter, freeze / gradient-checkpointing plumbing) is inherited
verbatim from
:class:`nanocosmos.models.cosmos_2_5_common.wrapper_base._BaseCosmos25Wrapper`.
This file owns only:

* the Cosmos 3 variant registry (``variants.py``);
* the diffusers class names to load (``Cosmos3OmniTransformer`` +
  the shared ``AutoencoderKLWan``);
* the HF-snapshot ignore list (skip the unused omni sub-towers);
* the omni forward call (:meth:`_run_dit_forward`).

Because the base DiT is kept on the ``self.dit`` attribute -- exactly
as Predict / Transfer do -- every downstream convention that keys on
``model.dit.*`` keeps working unchanged: the optimiser param-group
split, the ``freeze_dit_backbone`` schedule, and the
``ckpt_path_skip_prefixes=[model.dit.]`` warm-start filter.

    """Cosmos 3 (Nano) omni transformer as a volumetric EM feature extractor.

    A single unified task head produces ``[B, head_channels, D, H, W]``
    (default ``HEAD_CHANNELS = N_AFF + 2``: per-offset affinities + a
    foreground/semantic channel + a linear raw-reconstruction channel);
    the channel layout is owned by :mod:`nanocosmos.losses._common`.

    The depth axis of the EM volume maps to the model's temporal (video)
    axis, exactly as for the Cosmos 2.5 wrappers::

        EM volume  [B, C, D, H, W]  <->  video  [B, C, T, H, W]

    The Wan2.2-TI2V VAE compresses 16x spatially and 4x temporally into
    a 48-channel latent grid, which the omni transformer's diffusion
    tower then processes.

    Args:
        in_channels: Number of input channels (1 for EM volumes).
        head_channels: Unified head width (default ``HEAD_CHANNELS``).
        feature_size: Internal feature map channel count after projection.
        variant: Cosmos 3 variant key (only ``"Nano"`` is published).
        dtype: Weight dtype.  Cosmos 3 is officially BF16-only; keep
            ``"bf16"`` unless you know what you are doing.
        pretrained: Auto-pull ``nvidia/Cosmos3-Nano`` from HF on first
            instantiation.
        freeze_dit_backbone: ``True`` / ``False`` / ``N`` (frozen for
            epochs ``0..N-1``, thawed at epoch ``N``).  Strongly
            recommended to keep frozen (or warm-up frozen) on a 16B
            backbone -- an end-to-end fine-tune needs a lot of memory.
        feature_layers: Omni-transformer block indices to extract
            features from.  Defaults (from the base class) to four
            evenly-spaced layers across the 36-layer stack.

    Example::

        >>> model = Cosmos3Nano3DWrapper(in_channels=1, variant="Nano")
        >>> x = torch.randn(1, 1, 16, 256, 256)
        >>> out = model(x)

        """Rebuild ``proj_in`` / ``proj_out`` for ``latent_patch_size = 1``.

        Cosmos 3's omni transformer patchifies the VAE latent's H/W axes by
        ``latent_patch_size`` (``p``) *before* the token stack: a ``p x p``
        spatial patch of the 48-channel latent is flattened to a
        ``patch_latent_dim = p*p*48`` vector and projected to ``hidden`` by
        ``proj_in`` (``proj_out`` does the inverse for the diffusion
        prediction).  With the published ``p = 2`` the feature grid is only
        ``H/(16*2) x W/(16*2) = H/32 x W/32`` (an 8x8 grid for a 256x256
        crop), which the decoder upsamples 32x -> the visible ~32px blocky
        pattern in the ``pred/*`` panels.

        Setting ``p = 1`` makes the feature grid the *full* VAE latent grid
        (``H/16 x W/16`` -> 16x16 for 256x256), 4x finer spatially.  But
        ``p`` is baked into the pretrained projection dims
        (``proj_in: 192 -> hidden``, ``proj_out: hidden -> 192``), so it is
        NOT a free config flag: both layers must be rebuilt at
        ``patch_latent_dim = 1*1*48 = 48``.

        To preserve the 16B backbone's warm start we do **not** randomly
        re-initialise them -- we down-project the pretrained patch-embed by
        **averaging over the ``p x p`` spatial sub-positions** (the standard,
        scale-preserving way to retarget a patch embedding to a finer patch;
        cf. ViT patch-resize).  The flatten order in
        ``_patchify_and_pack_latents`` is ``(p_h, p_w, c)``
        (einsum ``cthpwq->thwpqc`` then ``reshape(-1, p*p*c)``), so the
        pretrained ``[hidden, p*p*c]`` weight reshapes to
        ``[hidden, p, p, c]`` and the mean over dims ``(p, p)`` yields the
        ``[hidden, c]`` unit-patch weight (bias is ``hidden``-dim, unchanged).
        ``proj_out`` is the mirror (``[p*p*c, hidden] -> [c, hidden]``; its
        ``[p*p*c]`` bias -> ``[c]``); note its output is *not* used by the
        feature path (we hook intermediate blocks), but it must stay
        shape-consistent so the model's (ignored) prediction tail does not
        crash.

        Finally ``register_to_config(latent_patch_size=1, patch_latent_dim=48)``
        makes ``_patchify_and_pack_latents`` / ``_unpatchify_and_unpack_latents``
        (which read ``self.config.latent_patch_size`` live) agree with the new
        projection dims.  Idempotent: a no-op if the DiT is already at ``p=1``
        (e.g. when resuming from a nanocosmos checkpoint saved post-repatch).

        Cost: ``num_vision_tokens`` (hence the DiT sequence length) grows 4x,
        so self-attention compute grows ~16x and activation memory ~4x.  On
        the 16B backbone this is the tightest memory point of the run -- pair
        it with gradient checkpointing and/or a smaller batch.

        Features are captured by the persistent block hooks (see

        make ``self.dit`` *run* a single denoising-step forward over one
        video latent with **null text / image / audio conditioning**.

        Unlike the Cosmos 2.5 ``CosmosTransformer3DModel`` (which takes a
        ``hidden_states`` latent + cross-attention text embeddings),
        ``Cosmos3OmniTransformer.forward`` consumes a *packed, unbatched*
        joint token stream and explicit index/position bookkeeping.  We
        reconstruct the minimal version of that stream the diffusers
        ``Cosmos3OmniPipeline`` builds for an unconditional video forward:

        * ``input_ids`` / ``text_indexes`` / ``und_len`` -- a single
          dummy understanding (causal) token; the model always expects a
          non-empty text prefix that the generation tokens cross-attend
          to.  ``und_len = 1`` ⇒ the generation stream is exactly the
          vision tokens.
        * ``vision_tokens`` -- ``[latent]`` (one ``[1, 48, T, H, W]``
          item).  The transformer patchifies H/W by ``latent_patch_size``
          internally -- temporal is **not** patchified -- and projects
          ``p*p*48 → hidden`` via ``proj_in``.  We retarget ``p`` to ``1``
          at construction (see :meth:`_repatch_to_unit_latent_patch`), so
          each latent pixel is its own token (``1*1*48 = 48 → hidden``) and
          the feature grid is the full ``H/16 x W/16`` VAE grid.  Either way
          we pass the raw latent, *not* a pre-patchified token tensor.
        * ``vision_token_shapes`` -- ``[(T, ceil(H/p), ceil(W/p))]`` patch
          grid for that item (``p = 1`` after the repatch).
        * ``vision_sequence_indexes`` -- ``arange(und_len, und_len + N)``;
          places all ``N`` vision tokens immediately after the text
          prefix (so the generation half of the sequence == vision).
        * ``vision_mse_loss_indexes`` -- same indices (every frame is
          noisy ⇒ every vision token is read back); only used to build
          the ignored return value.
        * ``vision_noisy_frame_indexes`` -- ``[arange(T)]`` (no image
          conditioning ⇒ all frames noisy).
        * ``vision_timesteps`` -- a single shared diffusion timestep
          broadcast over every (noisy) vision token, mirroring the
          ``timestep = 0`` convention the Cosmos 2.5 feature path uses.
        * ``position_ids`` -- ``[3, sequence_length]`` unified-3D-mRoPE
          ids: monotonic text ids, then VAE-token (t, h, w) grid ids
          offset past the text by ``unified_3d_mrope_temporal_modality_margin``
          (see :meth:`_build_position_ids`).
        * ``sequence_length`` -- ``und_len + N``.

        Sound / action conditioning is omitted entirely (the sound
        kwargs default to ``None`` and the model skips that branch).

        * **Token grid.** The base class derives ``(d_tok, h_tok, w_tok)``
          assuming all three latent axes are patchified by ``patch_size``.
          Cosmos 3 patchifies only H/W (by ``latent_patch_size``) and
          leaves the temporal axis intact, so we recompute the grid as
          ``(D, ceil(H/p), ceil(W/p))`` from the (already padded) latent.
        * **Batch.** The omni transformer is unbatched, so we run one
          forward per sample and stack the per-layer ``[N, hidden]``
          captures into ``[B, N, hidden]`` for the projector.

        NOTE (spatial resolution / blocky predictions): the feature grid is
        ``H/(16*p) x W/(16*p)`` where ``p = latent_patch_size`` and the
        Wan2.2 VAE's 16x spatial compression is fixed.  We retarget ``p`` to
        ``1`` at construction (:meth:`_repatch_to_unit_latent_patch`), so the
        grid is the *full* ``H/16 x W/16`` VAE latent grid -- a 16x16 grid for
        a 256x256 crop, 4x finer than the published ``p = 2`` (8x8) and on par
        with Cosmos-2.5's effective 16x.  This is the fix for the ~32px blocky
        pattern that the ``p = 2`` (32x total) grid produced in the ``pred/*``
        panels (confirmed by runtime shape logging to be an intrinsic grid
        effect, not a token/decoder bug -- temporal handling is correct,
        ``grid_d = D_lat`` decoded 4x).  The VAE's 16x is the floor and cannot
        be lowered further.  Cost: ``num_vision_tokens`` (DiT sequence length)

           omni DiT + bf16 Wan VAE, fp32 feature projector / ``to_latent``
           / task head, and an fp32-pinned ``time_embedder`` -- whose
           dtype boundaries we manage explicitly with casts.  Under an
           *outer* bf16 autocast (Lightning ``precision: bf16-mixed``
           wraps the whole ``training_step`` in
           ``torch.autocast(dtype=bfloat16)``) the autocast "promote"
           ops (``cat`` / ``stack`` / ``index_put`` ...) try to rank the
           floating dtypes flowing through this mixed graph and hit
           ``at::autocast::prioritize`` -> *"Unexpected floating
           ScalarType"* (autocast_mode.h: a promote op seeing a non-bf16
           lower-precision float alongside bf16 with no fp32 arg falls
           through).  The backbone is already natively bf16, so the outer
           autocast is redundant; disabling it makes the autocast path run
           byte-for-byte like the verified eager (no-autocast) path and
           removes the wrapper's ops from autocast's promotion logic
           entirely.

        2. **fp32 head dtype shim.**  The projector / ``to_latent`` / head
           run in fp32, but the shared ``_encode_and_extract`` casts the
           features back to the *input* dtype; a bf16 input would feed
           bf16 activations into the fp32 head.  We upcast the features to
