    """Zero out boundary voxels in instance labels (label × (1 − boundary)).

    Uses thinnest boundary (connectivity=1) so boundary voxels are
    zeroed: ``label[boundary] = 0``.

    **Anisotropy handling** — When ``pixel_size`` is provided and the
    z-resolution is more than 2× coarser than xy, boundary detection is
    restricted to the xy plane (no z-neighbours).  This prevents
    physically thick boundaries along the low-resolution axis.

    For single-channel (binary) semantic segmentation, boundary voxels
    become 0 (background) in the keyed label and the derived semantic
    target ``(label > 0)``.  This teaches the semantic head to predict
    thin gaps between touching instances, aiding instance separation.

    **No-full-erase guard** — erosion only opens gaps *between* instances;
    any instance that the boundary pass would remove **entirely** (e.g. a
    thin-along-z sheet under full-3D detection on isotropic volumes such as
    FIB-25 8 nm) is restored, so it never silently becomes false background
    in the semantic target.

    The keyed array is the only thing modified, so the caller controls
    scope: applying this to ``label`` erodes everything derived from it
    (sem + affinity targets), while applying it to a dedicated
    ``sem_label`` copy (the datamodule's ``boundary_target: semantic``
    mode) erodes the foreground target only and leaves the instance
    ``label`` -- hence the affinity targets -- untouched.

    Expects input labels in ``[C, *spatial]`` format (post
    ``EnsureChannelFirstd``).  Each channel is processed independently.

    Args:
        keys: Keys of instance label maps to process.
        mode: Boundary mode (``'inner'``, ``'outer'``, ``'thick'``).
        connectivity: 1 = face-adjacent only (thinnest boundaries).
        prob: Probability of applying the transform per sample.
        pixel_size: Voxel dimensions ``(z, y, x)`` in physical units,
            matching the array dimension order.  When z is >2× coarser
            than xy, xy-only boundary detection is used automatically.
