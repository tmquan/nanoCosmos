## Reading order for a brand-new contributor

1. **Top-level [`README.md`](../README.md)** — what the project is, install, train.
2. **[`STRUCTURE.md`](./STRUCTURE.md)** — folder map (5 minutes).
3. **[`WALKTHROUGH.md`](./WALKTHROUGH.md)** — the end-to-end "follow one batch" narrative with file:line citations.
4. **[`MUTEXWATERSHED.md`](./MUTEXWATERSHED.md)** — head channel layout, loss, and Mutex Watershed eval; **[`ARCHITECT.md`](./ARCHITECT.md)** — backbone parameter budgets and data flow.
5. **[`ORGANIZATION.md`](./ORGANIZATION.md)** — design philosophy.
6. **[`GOTCHAS.md`](./GOTCHAS.md)** — keep this one open while you're debugging.
7. **[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** — when you want to add something.

## Reading order for an ML researcher already familiar with PyTorch Lightning

1. **[`MUTEXWATERSHED.md`](./MUTEXWATERSHED.md)** — the affinity head, loss, and Mutex Watershed eval (the current head math).
2. **[`WALKTHROUGH.md`](./WALKTHROUGH.md)** — for the freeze schedule + Mutex Watershed agglomeration at eval.
3. **[`GOTCHAS.md`](./GOTCHAS.md)** — read this *before* you trust any number.

## Reading order for "future me, six months from now"

`STRUCTURE.md` → `GOTCHAS.md` → grep.  In that order.
