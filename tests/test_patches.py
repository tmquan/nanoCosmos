"""
Tests for :func:`nanocosmos.datasets._patches.generate_patch_indices`.

The generator is dataset-agnostic and pure -- it just turns a volume
shape + patch size + overlap into a list of slice triples.  Tests below
verify the row-major ordering, full coverage, and the back-shift rule
that prevents zero-padded edge patches.
